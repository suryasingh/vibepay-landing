Today, we're excited to introduce **VibePay** - the complete infrastructure for AI app developers who want to monetize their apps with credits, accelerate user growth, and sell globally without the compliance nightmare.

## The Problem We're Solving

Building AI applications is challenging enough. But when it comes to monetization, developers face a perfect storm of complexity:

- **Variable AI costs** that traditional payment models can't handle elegantly
- **User retention challenges** that require sophisticated growth mechanics  
- **Global tax compliance** that becomes impossible at scale

Most developers end up building their own credit systems, spending months on payment logic, tax calculations, and growth features - time that should be spent on their core AI product.

## Our Solution: Credits + Growth, Built for Scale

VibePay solves this with a complete infrastructure stack:

### üè¶ **Merchant of Record Services**
We handle all the complex stuff - tax calculations, compliance, regulatory liability across 180+ countries. You focus on building; we handle the legal maze.

### üí≥ **Credit Infrastructure** 
Native credit systems designed for AI apps. Handle variable costs, microtransactions, and bulk purchases with enterprise-grade reliability.

### üöÄ **Growth Engine**
Built-in retention mechanics that turn casual users into power users. Rewards, achievements, streaks - all the psychology that works.

### üìä **Real-time Analytics**
Understand your revenue, user behavior, and growth metrics with dashboards built specifically for credit-based AI apps.

## Built for Developers, By Developers

Our SDK integrates in minutes, not months:

```javascript
import { VibePay } from '@vibepay/sdk'

// Charge credits for AI usage
const result = await VibePay.charge({
  userId: user.id,
  credits: 25,
  description: 'Generated AI artwork'
})

// Reward user engagement  
await VibePay.reward({
  userId: user.id,
  credits: 10,
  reason: 'daily_login'
})
```

## What's Next?

We're currently in closed beta, working with select AI app developers to perfect the platform. If you're building an AI app and dealing with monetization challenges, we'd love to chat.
